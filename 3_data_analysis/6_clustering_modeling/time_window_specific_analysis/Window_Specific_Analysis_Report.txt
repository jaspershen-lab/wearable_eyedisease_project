KEY FINDINGS:
🏆 MOST PREDICTIVE WINDOW: Early Recovery
   - Highest success rate: 4.2% significant correlations
   - Total significant: 1 correlations

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PRIORITY MONITORING: Focus on Early Recovery window for prediction
2. OUTCOME-SPECIFIC PATTERNS: Different windows may be optimal for OCTA vs Vision
3. PERSONALIZED TIMING: Use window-specific membership for risk assessment
4. MULTI-WINDOW INTEGRATION: Consider combining multiple windows for enhanced prediction
