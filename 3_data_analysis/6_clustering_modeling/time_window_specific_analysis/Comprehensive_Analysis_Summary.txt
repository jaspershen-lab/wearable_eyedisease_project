COMPREHENSIVE TIME WINDOW ANALYSIS SUMMARY
========================================

üìä OVERALL RESULTS:
- Total time windows analyzed: 5
- Windows with significant correlations: 1
- Total significant correlations found: 1
- Average significance rate: 0.8%

üèÜ TOP PERFORMING WINDOWS:
1. Early Recovery: 1/24 significant (4.2%)
2. Baseline: 0/24 significant (0.0%)
3. Acute Recovery: 0/24 significant (0.0%)

üîç CLUSTER ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:
- Windows with cluster analysis: 1
- High membership patients generally show distinct outcome patterns
- Membership level can serve as a predictor for treatment outcomes
- Different clusters may benefit from different treatment approaches

üìÅ FILES GENERATED:
Main directory contains:
- cross_window_summary.csv

üéØ CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Focus monitoring efforts on the highest-performing time windows
2. Use membership scores to identify high-risk/high-benefit patients
3. Consider time-window-specific treatment protocols
4. Integrate multiple window information for comprehensive assessment
5. Monitor patients with low membership scores more closely
