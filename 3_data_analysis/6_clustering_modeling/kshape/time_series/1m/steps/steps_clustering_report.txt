STEPS COUNT TRAJECTORY CLUSTERING ANALYSIS
============================================

Analysis performed on: 2025-05-09 13:41:13 

Quality Control Process:
- Subjects were required to have at least 15 days of data
- Subjects were required to have data during the perioperative period (-2 to +2 days from surgery)

Group 1 (No Diabetes, Surgery Type 0):
Original subjects: 28 
Subjects after QC: 20 ( 87 %)

Group 2 (Diabetes, Surgery Type 1):
Original subjects: 19 
Subjects after QC: 14 ( 93.3 %)

Method: Hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance

============================================
CONCLUSION
============================================

This analysis identified distinct steps count trajectory patterns within each patient group during the perioperative period (4 days before to 30 days after surgery).

Quality Control Summary:
- All subjects were required to have at least 15 days of data
- All subjects were required to have data during the perioperative period
- Group 1: 20 of 23 subjects passed QC (87%)
- Group 2: 14 of 15 subjects passed QC (93.3%)

Key findings:
1. Different physical activity recovery patterns were observed within each group.
2. Check the generated plots to visualize these patterns.
3. Statistical analysis shows differences in mean steps count between clusters.
4. Further clinical interpretation is recommended to understand the significance of these activity patterns in recovery from surgery.
