SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REPORT
Excluding SH035 Sample: PPV+IVI vs IVI Only Validation
========================================================

OBJECTIVE
Assess whether the wearable device prediction model depends on
patients with special surgical procedures (PPV+IVI vs IVI only)
by excluding the SH035 sample from the analysis.

METHODOLOGY
- Exclusion Criteria: SH035 sample removed
- Model Type: Bayesian logistic regression
- Features: CV RHR + Steps Max (Late Recovery period)
- Comparison: Main analysis vs Sensitivity analysis

SAMPLE CHANGES
- Original Sample Size: 11
- Sensitivity Analysis Size: 10
- Excluded Samples: 1

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
Main Analysis AUC: 0.821
Sensitivity Analysis AUC: 0.762
AUC Difference: -0.060
Accuracy Difference: -0.009

PARAMETER COMPARISON
cv_rhr_scaled:
  Main: -1.820, Sensitivity: -1.878, Diff: -0.058
steps_max_scaled:
  Main: 1.971, Sensitivity: 1.255, Diff: -0.717

ROBUSTNESS ASSESSMENT
AUC Stability: SENSITIVE (|diff| = 0.060)
Parameter Stability: SENSITIVE
Overall Assessment: MODEL SENSITIVE

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
1. Model shows sensitivity to SH035 sample exclusion
2. Further investigation needed for SH035 characteristics
3. Potential surgical procedure-specific effects
4. Model validation in larger, diverse samples recommended
5. Caution advised for clinical implementation

CONCLUSION
This sensitivity analysis evaluated the robustness of the
wearable device prediction model by excluding the SH035 sample
to test for dependency on special surgical procedures. The
analysis revealed some sensitivity to sample composition,
suggesting the need for larger validation studies.
