Wearable Device Metrics for OCTA Prognosis Prediction
Two-Model Bayesian Analysis Report
========================================================

STUDY DESIGN
- Analysis Strategy: Two-model comparison
- Primary Analysis: Wearable device model
- Sensitivity Analysis: Combined model (wearable + clinical)
- Analysis Date: 2025-09-16

SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
- Total Sample Size: 11
- Good Prognosis (OCTA Cluster 2): 7 cases (63.6%)
- Poor Prognosis (OCTA Cluster 1): 4 cases (36.4%)
- Time Window: Late Recovery Period (Days 16-30 post-surgery)

PREDICTIVE FEATURES
- CV RHR (Coefficient of Variation of Resting Heart Rate)
- Steps Max (Maximum daily steps)
- Age and Gender (combined model only)
- Note: HbA1c excluded due to small sample anomalies

BAYESIAN METHODOLOGY
- Prior Distributions: Weakly informative priors
  * Coefficients: Normal(0, 2.5)
  * Intercept: Normal(0, 5)
- MCMC: 4 chains, 4000 iterations, 2000 warmup
- Convergence: All R-hat < 1.1

MODEL PERFORMANCE RESULTS

Wearable Devices:
- AUC: 0.821
- Accuracy: 0.909
- Sensitivity: 1.000
- Specificity: 0.750

Combined Model:
- AUC: 0.893
- Accuracy: 0.909
- Sensitivity: 1.000
- Specificity: 0.750

KEY FINDINGS
1. Wearable device metrics demonstrate independent predictive value
   - Standalone AUC: 0.821
2. Combined model shows potential improvement: +0.071 AUC
3. CV RHR and Steps Max provide complementary information
4. Age and gender contribute additional predictive value

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
1. Late Recovery monitoring (Days 16-30) is clinically meaningful
2. Wearable devices provide objective, continuous assessment
3. CV RHR reflects autonomic recovery patterns
4. Steps Max indicates functional recovery capacity
5. Non-invasive approach suitable for routine implementation

STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION
- CV RHR: Higher variability associated with poorer prognosis
- Steps Max: Higher activity levels associated with better prognosis
- 90% credible intervals exclude zero for key predictors
- Bayesian approach provides uncertainty quantification

STUDY LIMITATIONS
1. Small sample size (n=11) limits generalizability
2. Single-center, retrospective design
3. Cross-validation may overestimate performance
4. Need for prospective validation in larger cohorts
5. HbA1c relationship requires further investigation

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Validate findings in multi-center prospective study
2. Investigate optimal prediction time windows
3. Explore additional wearable-derived metrics
4. Develop clinical decision support algorithms
5. Consider integration with standard clinical assessments

CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates the potential of wearable device metrics
for predicting OCTA surgical outcomes during the Late Recovery
period. The independent predictive value of CV RHR and Steps Max
supports the clinical utility of continuous monitoring approaches.
Combined with basic clinical information, these metrics may
enhance personalized prognosis assessment, though validation
in larger samples is essential.
