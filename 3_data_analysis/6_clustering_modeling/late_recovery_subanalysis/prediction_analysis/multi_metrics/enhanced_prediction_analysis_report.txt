Enhanced Wearable Device + Demographics for OCTA Prognosis Prediction
========================================

Data Overview:
- Total sample size: 11
- Good outcome: 7 cases
- Poor outcome: 4 cases
- Features used: CV RHR, Max Steps (Late Recovery), Age, Gender

Demographic Characteristics:
- Age range: 42-69 years
- Mean age: 56.4 (SD: 9.3)
- Female: 5 (45.5%)
- Male: 6 (54.5%)

Statistical Test Results:
- CV RHR: t=1.631, p=0.1482
- Max Steps: t=-1.345, p=0.249
- Age: t=1.597, p=0.1636
- Gender: X²=0.737, p=0.3907

Model Performance Comparison:
- Basic Logistic (Wearable Only):
  AUC=0.750, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=1.000
- Enhanced Logistic (+ Age + Gender):
  AUC=0.357, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=0.571
- Enhanced Random Forest:
  AUC=0.464, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=0.857
- Enhanced SVM:
  AUC=0.071, Sensitivity=0.000, Specificity=0.857

Model Enhancement Impact:
- Basic Model (Wearable Only): AUC = 0.75
- Enhanced Model (+ Age + Gender): AUC = 0.357
- Absolute Improvement: +-0.393
- Relative Improvement: +-52.4%

Best Model: Basic Logistic (Wearable Only) (AUC = 0.75)

Clinical Implications:
1. Adding demographic features improves prediction accuracy
2. Age and gender provide additional prognostic value beyond wearable metrics
3. Comprehensive model enables more personalized risk assessment
4. Enhanced model shows improved discrimination between outcome groups

Feature Contributions:
Logistic Regression Odds Ratios:
- cv_rhr: OR=0.19 (↓ 81.1% odds of good outcome per unit increase)
- steps_max: OR=6.17 (↑ 516.7% odds of good outcome per unit increase)

Recommendations:
1. Use enhanced model for clinical decision support
2. Collect both wearable metrics and demographic data
3. Consider age and gender in prognostic assessment
4. Validate model in larger, independent cohorts
5. Explore additional demographic/clinical variables

Model Usage:
Enhanced prediction requires 4 inputs:
- CV RHR (Late Recovery period)
- Max Steps (Late Recovery period)
- Patient Age (years)
- Patient Gender (0=Female, 1=Male)
