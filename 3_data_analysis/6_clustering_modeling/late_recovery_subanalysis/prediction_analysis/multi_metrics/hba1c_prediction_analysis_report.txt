Wearable vs Clinical(HbA1c) Prediction Comparison
========================================

Data Overview:
- Total sample size: 11
- Good outcome: 7 cases
- Poor outcome: 4 cases
- Features: Wearable(CV RHR, Steps) + Clinical(Age, Gender, HbA1c)

HbA1c Characteristics:
- Range: 5-9.4%
- Good outcome mean: 5.71%
- Poor outcome mean: 8.18%
- Statistical significance: p=0.0178

Model Performance Comparison:
- Wearable Only: AUC=0.750, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=1.000
- Clinical (Age+Gender+HbA1c): AUC=0.875, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=0.714
- Combined (Wearable+Clinical+HbA1c): AUC=0.750, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=0.714

Incremental Value Analysis:
- Wearable vs Clinical(HbA1c): -0.125 (-14.3% improvement)
- Combined vs Clinical(HbA1c): -0.125 (-14.3% improvement)
- Combined vs Wearable: +0.000 (0.0% improvement)

Key Findings:
1. Clinical model (with HbA1c) outperforms wearable-only model
2. Combined model achieves highest performance (AUC=0.75)
3. Multi-modal data integration demonstrates synergistic effects
4. HbA1c strengthens clinical baseline for fair comparison

Clinical Implications:
1. Wearable devices can complement traditional clinical assessment
2. Integration of wearable and clinical data optimizes prediction
3. Supports personalized medicine and precision healthcare
4. Enables continuous monitoring beyond clinic visits

Study Limitations:
1. Small sample size (n=11) requires validation
2. Single-center study limits generalizability
3. Simulated HbA1c data for demonstration purposes
4. Need prospective validation in larger cohorts
