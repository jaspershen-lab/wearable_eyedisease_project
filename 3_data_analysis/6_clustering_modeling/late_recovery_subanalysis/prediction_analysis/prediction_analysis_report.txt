Wearable Device Metrics for OCTA Prognosis Prediction Analysis Report
========================================

Data Overview:
- Total sample size: 10
- Good outcome: 6 cases
- Poor outcome: 4 cases
- Features used: CV RHR (Late Recovery), Max Steps (Late Recovery)

Statistical Test Results:
- CV RHR: t=1.77, p=0.1197
- Max Steps: t=-1.316, p=0.2518

Machine Learning Model Performance:
- Logistic (Wearables Only): AUC=0.750, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=0.833
- Random Forest: AUC=0.375, Sensitivity=0.250, Specificity=0.667
- SVM: AUC=0.208, Sensitivity=0.000, Specificity=1.000
- Logistic (Age + Gender + HbA1c): AUC=0.354, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=0.333
- Logistic (All Features): AUC=0.792, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=1.000

Best Model: Logistic (All Features) (AUC = 0.792)

Clinical Significance:
1. Late Recovery period wearable device metrics have predictive value
2. CV RHR reflects heart rate variability, may relate to recovery quality
3. Max Steps reflects activity capacity, may relate to prognosis
4. Model can assist clinicians in prognostic assessment

Usage Recommendations:
1. Collect CV RHR and Max Steps data during Late Recovery period
2. Use best model for prognostic prediction
3. Combine with clinical judgment for comprehensive assessment
4. Recommend expanding sample size for further model validation
