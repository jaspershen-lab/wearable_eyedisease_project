Wearable Device Metrics for OCTA Prognosis Prediction
Final Analysis Report
========================================================

STUDY OVERVIEW
- Analysis Date: 2025-07-30
- Total Sample Size: 11
- Good Prognosis: 7 cases (63.6%)
- Poor Prognosis: 4 cases (36.4%)
- Primary Features: CV RHR and Max Steps (Late Recovery Period)

DATA QUALITY
- No simulated data used - all analyses based on real measurements
- Complete case analysis performed
- Late Recovery Period: Days 16-30 post-surgery
- Clinical variables included: Age, Gender, HbA1c

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
- Normality Tests: Shapiro-Wilk test
- Group Comparisons: Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric)
- Effect Sizes: Cohen's d
- CV RHR Effect Size: 1.001
- Steps Max Effect Size: -0.997

PRIMARY ANALYSIS RESULTS (Logistic Regression)
- Wearable Devices: AUC=0.750, Sensitivity=0.750, Specificity=1.000
- Clinical (Age+Gender+HbA1c): AUC=0.354, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=0.333
- Combined (All): AUC=0.792, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=1.000

Best Performing Model: Combined (All) (AUC = 0.792)

SUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS (Machine Learning)
- Random Forest: AUC=0.429, Sensitivity=0.250, Specificity=0.857
- SVM: AUC=0.714, Sensitivity=0.500, Specificity=0.714

KEY FINDINGS
1. Wearable device metrics show predictive value for OCTA prognosis
2. Late Recovery period (Days 16-30) provides meaningful signals
3. CV RHR and Max Steps complement each other as predictors
4. Combined model improvement over wearable-only: +0.042 AUC points

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
1. Continuous monitoring via wearables offers objective prognosis assessment
2. Non-invasive approach suitable for routine clinical implementation
3. Late Recovery period appears most informative for prediction
4. Integration with clinical data may enhance predictive accuracy

LIMITATIONS
1. Small sample size (n=11) requires validation in larger cohorts
2. Single-center study limits generalizability
3. Cross-validation may overestimate performance
4. Need for prospective validation studies

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Validate findings in multi-center study with larger sample
2. Explore optimal time windows for prediction
3. Investigate additional wearable-derived metrics
4. Develop clinical decision support tools

TECHNICAL NOTES
- Cross-validation: LOOCV
- No data imputation or simulation used
- Robust statistical testing with effect size reporting
- Primary focus on interpretable logistic regression
