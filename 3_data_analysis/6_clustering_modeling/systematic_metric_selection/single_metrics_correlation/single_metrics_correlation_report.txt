Single Metrics vs OCTA Clustering Correlation Analysis Report
========================================

🎯 Analysis Objective:
Directly evaluate the correlation between each candidate wearable metric and OCTA clustering
No composite metrics used, focusing on individual metric predictive potential

📊 Candidate Metrics:
- Heart Rate Variability: cv_rhr_1, mean_rhr_1, max_rhr_1, min_rhr_1
- Step Count Activity: steps_max, steps_mean, steps_total
- Time Windows: baseline, acute_recovery, early_recovery, mid_recovery, late_recovery

📈 Overall Results:
- Total tests: 35 (7 metrics × 5 time windows)
- Significant correlations: 0 (0.0%)
- Meaningful correlations (|r|≥0.3): 7 (20.0%)
- Weak correlation trends (0.1≤|r|<0.3): 22 (62.9%)
- Strongest correlation: 0.494 (mean_rhr_1 in baseline time window)

🏆 Best Performing Metrics:
1. mean_rhr_1 (baseline): r=0.494, p=0.220 (Non-significant)
2. cv_rhr_1 (late_recovery): r=-0.418, p=0.159 (Non-significant)
3. max_rhr_1 (early_recovery): r=0.359, p=0.152 (Non-significant)
4. steps_mean (early_recovery): r=0.359, p=0.563 (Non-significant)
5. steps_mean (late_recovery): r=0.359, p=0.330 (Non-significant)

💡 Key Conclusions:
✅ Found 7 metrics showing meaningful correlation (|r|≥0.3)
⚠️ No metrics achieved statistical significance, but correlation trends still have reference value
🎯 Recommended focus: mean_rhr_1 (baseline time window), strongest correlation (r=0.494)
