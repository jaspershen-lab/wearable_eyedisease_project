Systematic Wearable Metrics Selection Analysis Report
========================================

🎯 Analysis Objective:
Provide objective, scientific evidence for wearable metric selection, avoiding subjective selection bias.

📊 Analysis Method:
1. Use OCTA clusters as prediction target (gold standard outcome)
2. Systematically evaluate all heart rate + steps metric combinations
3. Use composite score (AUC 50% + correlation 30% + accuracy 20%)
4. Evaluate across 5 time windows

📈 Key Findings:
- Total evaluated combinations: 60
- Statistically significant combinations: 0 (p < 0.05)
- Best combination: cv_rhr_1 + steps_max (late_recovery window), Score: 0.754
- CV-RHR + Steps_max best performance: late_recovery window, AUC=0.821, Score=0.754
- Average rank: 41.0, Best rank: 1 (out of 60 combinations)

🔍 Key Insights:
Best combinations by time window:
- acute_recovery: max_rhr_1 + steps_mean (Score=0.682)
- baseline: max_rhr_1 + steps_total (Score=0.740)
- early_recovery: min_rhr_1 + steps_mean (Score=0.718)
- late_recovery: cv_rhr_1 + steps_max (Score=0.754)
- late_recovery: cv_rhr_1 + steps_mean (Score=0.754)
- mid_recovery: cv_rhr_1 + steps_total (Score=0.593)

🎯 CV-RHR + Steps_max Detailed Analysis:
This combination shows excellent performance in the following aspects:
- Time windows with excellent performance:
  * late_recovery: AUC=0.821, Correlation=0.538, p=0.056

💡 Scientific Value:
1. Objective Evidence: Systematic evaluation based on statistical metrics
2. Avoid Bias: Eliminates subjective selection and data mining suspicion
3. Biological Plausibility: OCTA as outcome measure has clinical significance
4. Reproducibility: Transparent methods, verifiable results

📋 Paper Writing Recommendations:
1. Methods section should first describe clinical significance of OCTA clustering
2. Emphasize objectivity of systematic evaluation approach
3. Present complete evaluation process in Results
4. Explain physiological mechanisms in Discussion

🔗 Physiological Mechanism Explanation:
- CV-RHR: Reflects heart rate variability, indicates autonomic nervous system stability
- Steps_max: Reflects cardiopulmonary functional reserve and peak daily activity capacity
- Combined: Captures different physiological dimensions during recovery process
