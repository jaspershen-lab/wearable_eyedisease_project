🎯 HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS:
When you see 'Early Recovery has significant correlation':
✅ NOW: Check Primary_Cluster column to see exactly which cluster drives this correlation
✅ NOW: Use Cluster_Distribution to understand all cluster patterns in that window
✅ NOW: Compare Primary_Cluster_Mean_Outcome across different correlations

📋 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE GUIDELINES:
- |r| ≥ 0.5: Large effect - Clinically very significant
- |r| ≥ 0.3: Medium effect - Clinically significant
- |r| ≥ 0.1: Small effect - May be clinically relevant
- Primary_Cluster_N ≥ 5: Good cluster stability
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant
- p_FDR < 0.05: Significant after multiple comparison correction

🔬 RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:
1. Each significant correlation now has time-window and cluster-specific context
2. Can identify which recovery patterns in which time periods predict specific outcomes
3. Primary_Cluster information enables targeted patient stratification by time window
4. Cluster_Distribution shows heterogeneity within each time window
5. Different time windows may have different optimal clusters for prediction

💡 NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Focus on time window-cluster combinations with Count ≥ 3 significant correlations
2. Investigate baseline characteristics of patients in predictive clusters
3. Validate time-window-cluster-specific predictions in independent cohorts
4. Develop time-window-cluster-based treatment decision algorithms
5. Consider interventions targeting specific time windows and clusters

🕐 TIME WINDOW SPECIFIC INSIGHTS:
- Baseline Window: Pre-surgical recovery patterns
- Acute Recovery: Immediate post-surgical patterns (0-3 days)
- Early Recovery: Early adaptation patterns (4-7 days)
- Mid Recovery: Intermediate recovery patterns (8-15 days)
- Late Recovery: Long-term recovery patterns (16-30 days)
