TIME WINDOW MAX MEMBERSHIP CLUSTERING ANALYSIS (FIXED)
========================================

🔧 CLUSTER LABEL FIXING APPLIED:
✅ All cluster labels are now consecutive (1, 2, 3, ...)
✅ No more missing cluster numbers (e.g., 1, 3 -> 1, 2)
✅ Visualization and analysis results are more intuitive
✅ Original cluster mapping preserved for reference

📊 ANALYSIS OVERVIEW:
- Analysis Date: 2025-06-02
- Clustering Method: Fuzzy C-means with Multiple Clusters per Time Window
- Time Windows Analyzed: 5
- Label Fix Applied: Consecutive cluster numbering

TIME WINDOW CLUSTERING RESULTS (FIXED):

1. BASELINE:
   - Patients: 14
   - Clusters: 2 (fixed labels)
   - Label Remapping: No
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.910 ± 0.003

2. ACUTE_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2 (fixed labels)
   - Label Remapping: No
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.506 ± 0.006

3. EARLY_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2 (fixed labels)
   - Label Remapping: No
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.931 ± 0.028

4. MID_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 14
   - Clusters: 2 (fixed labels)
   - Label Remapping: No
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.923 ± 0.033

5. LATE_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2 (fixed labels)
   - Label Remapping: Yes
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.339 ± 0.005

🔧 LABEL FIXING SUMMARY:
- Windows requiring label fix: 1/5
- Windows with original consecutive labels: 4/5

✅ PROBLEM SOLVED:
❌ Before: Late Recovery shows Cluster 1, Cluster 3 (confusing)
✅ After: Late Recovery shows Cluster 1, Cluster 2 (clear)

📁 GENERATED FILES (FIXED):
📁 Main Results:
- time_window_max_membership_data_fixed.csv: Wide format with fixed labels
- time_window_max_clustering_summary_fixed.csv: Summary with fix status

📁 Detailed Results (per time window):
- [window]_detailed_membership_fixed.csv: Complete membership data
- [window]_cluster_quality_fixed.csv: Cluster quality metrics
- [window]_membership_matrix_fixed.csv: Full membership matrices
- [window]_cluster_mapping.csv: Original->Fixed mapping (if applicable)

📊 Visualizations (Fixed):
- plots/max_membership_analysis_fixed/: Individual window analysis with fixed labels
- All plots now show consecutive cluster numbers

🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
1. Use the FIXED data files for all subsequent analysis
2. Replace 'time_window_max_membership_data.csv' with 'time_window_max_membership_data_fixed.csv'
3. All cluster references will now be consecutive (1, 2, 3, ...)
4. Clinical interpretation will be clearer and more intuitive

EXAMPLE USAGE (FIXED):
# Load the FIXED max membership data
max_membership_data <- read.csv('time_window_max_membership_data_fixed.csv')

# Now all cluster_[window] columns have consecutive numbers
# Example: Late Recovery will show clusters 1, 2 instead of 1, 3

# For correlation analysis:
# 'Significant correlation with Late Recovery Cluster 2' (clear!)
# instead of 'Significant correlation with Late Recovery Cluster 3' (confusing)
