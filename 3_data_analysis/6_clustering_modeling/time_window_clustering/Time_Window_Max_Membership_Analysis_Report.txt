TIME WINDOW MAX MEMBERSHIP CLUSTERING ANALYSIS
========================================

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW:
- Analysis Date: 2025-06-02
- Clustering Method: Fuzzy C-means with Multiple Clusters per Time Window
- Time Windows Analyzed: 5
- Max Membership Approach: True multi-cluster analysis within each time window

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
‚úì Each time window now contains 2-4 distinct clusters
‚úì True max_cluster and max_membership values generated
‚úì Silhouette analysis for optimal cluster number selection
‚úì Detailed membership matrices for each time window
‚úì Cluster quality assessment and visualization

TIME WINDOW CLUSTERING RESULTS:

1. BASELINE:
   - Patients: 14
   - Clusters: 2
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.910 ¬± 0.003
   - Range: [0.903, 0.913]

2. ACUTE_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.506 ¬± 0.006
   - Range: [0.500, 0.512]

3. EARLY_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.931 ¬± 0.028
   - Range: [0.918, 1.000]

4. MID_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 14
   - Clusters: 2
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.923 ¬± 0.033
   - Range: [0.906, 1.000]

5. LATE_RECOVERY:
   - Patients: 15
   - Clusters: 2
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.339 ¬± 0.005
   - Range: [0.333, 0.343]

BEST CLUSTERING QUALITY:
üèÜ Time Window: EARLY_RECOVERY
   - Mean Max Membership: 0.931
   - Number of Clusters: 2
   - Patient Count: 15

NOW YOU CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION:
‚úÖ Each significant correlation can be traced to a specific cluster!
‚úÖ Example: 'Early Recovery Cluster 2 shows significant correlation with GCL-IPL improvement'
‚úÖ Max membership values indicate how well patients fit their assigned cluster
‚úÖ Multiple clusters within each time window capture recovery heterogeneity

- time_window_max_clustering_summary.csv: Summary statistics

üìÅ Detailed Results (per time window):
- [window]_detailed_membership.csv: Complete membership data
- [window]_cluster_quality.csv: Cluster quality metrics
- [window]_membership_matrix.csv: Full membership matrices

üìä Visualizations:
- plots/max_membership_analysis/: Individual window analysis
- cross_window_max_membership_comparison.pdf: Overall comparison

NEXT STEPS FOR CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
1. Use max_cluster and max_membership columns for analysis
2. Correlate max_membership with OCTA/VA outcomes
3. Identify which specific clusters show significant correlations
4. Compare cluster-specific outcomes for clinical interpretation

EXAMPLE USAGE:
# Load the max membership data
max_membership_data <- read.csv('time_window_max_membership_data.csv')

# For early recovery window:
# - cluster_early_recovery: Shows which specific cluster (1, 2, 3, etc.)
# - membership_early_recovery: Shows max membership value

# Now you can identify:
# 'Significant correlation with Early Recovery Cluster 2'
# instead of just 'Early Recovery'
