🎯 INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:
- Cohen's d ≥ 0.8: Large effect (clinically very meaningful)
- Cohen's d ≥ 0.5: Medium effect (clinically meaningful)
- Cohen's d ≥ 0.2: Small effect (may be clinically relevant)
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant (before correction)
- p_FDR < 0.05: Significant after multiple comparison correction

🔬 STATISTICAL METHODS:
1. Student's t-test: Assumes equal variances
2. Welch's t-test: Does not assume equal variances (recommended)
3. Mann-Whitney U: Non-parametric alternative
4. Cohen's d: Standardized effect size
5. Hedges' g: Small sample corrected effect size
6. FDR correction: Controls false discovery rate

💡 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
1. Focus on large effect size differences (d ≥ 0.8)
2. Consider both statistical and clinical significance
3. Better clusters indicate more favorable recovery patterns
4. Time window differences suggest optimal intervention periods
5. Validate findings in independent cohorts

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
1. Investigate baseline characteristics of better-performing clusters
2. Develop cluster-specific treatment protocols
3. Validate cluster assignments in prospective studies
4. Consider time-window-specific interventions
5. Analyze cluster stability across different time windows
