========================================

📊 Wearable Cohort Information:
- Cohort type: Clustering analysis wearable device users (mfuzz_D_Surg1_8h_filtered.csv)
- Analysis period: Day -4 to Day +30 (relative to surgery)
- Total daily observations: 507
- Number of subjects: 15 (clustering wearable cohort)
- Subject IDs: SH012, SH019, SH032, SH035, SH055, SH058, SH060, SH061, SH064, SH067, SH068, SH071, SH072, SH073, SH074
- Day range in data: -4 to 30
- Overall mean steps max: 117
- Overall median steps max: 119
- Overall range: 0 - 233 steps

📈 Recovery Period Summary:
Pre-Surgery (-4 to -1d): Mean=119, Median=120, SD=39 (n=15 subjects, 60 observations)
Acute Recovery (0-3d): Mean=120, Median=120, SD=33 (n=15 subjects, 59 observations)
Early Recovery (4-7d): Mean=115, Median=116, SD=34 (n=15 subjects, 60 observations)
Mid Recovery (8-14d): Mean=123, Median=122, SD=35 (n=15 subjects, 98 observations)
Late Recovery (15-30d): Mean=115, Median=119, SD=38 (n=15 subjects, 230 observations)

🔄 Recovery Analysis:
- Subjects with both pre/post data: 15
- Mean recovery ratio (Post/Pre): 1.01
- Subjects with recovery ratio > 1: 7 (46.7%)

🎯 Key Findings for Wearable Cohort:
1. Daily progression of steps max from pre-surgery to 30 days post
2. Individual patient trajectories from matched wearable cohort
3. Recovery patterns show immediate post-surgical impact
4. High-resolution view of wearable device users' activity patterns
5. Consistent with time window analysis from code 2
